# Radar-Based Soccer Ball Goal Line Detection System
This repository contains the implementation, datasets, and results for our project, "Radar-Based Soccer Ball Goal Line Detection System." The project explores the feasibility of using radar technology to accurately detect and track a soccer ball's crossing of the goal line, providing a cost-effective and reliable alternative to existing goal-line technology. The core focus is on classifying radar reflections and leveraging object-specific radar cross-section (RCS) characteristics for real-time goal detection.

## Key Features:
1. **Radar Reflection Analysis:** Utilizes radar cross-section properties to differentiate the soccer ball from other objects like players or equipment.
2. **ML-Based Goal Detection:** Employs ResNet50 with ImageNet weights for binary classification (Goal/Not a Goal).
3. **Simulation-Driven Insights:** Includes Remcom WaveFarer simulations to analyze reflection patterns under various conditions.
4. **Evaluation and Results:** Presents the effect of radar placement and observation angles.
